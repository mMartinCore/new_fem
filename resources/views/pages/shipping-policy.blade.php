                        <br>
                        FEMPIREfreight will be responsible for your Shipment only while it is within
                        FEMPIREfreight’s custody or control, subject to the limitations of liability set out herein.

                        25. If the Shipment is transported by air and involves a stop in a country other than the
                        country of departure, you understand and acknowledge that an Airfreight Convention may apply and
                        may limit liability for loss or damage. Your claim for any loss or damage occurring during
                        carriage by air, is against the airline carrier. In the event of any loss or damage suffered by
                        you while the Goods are in the possession of the airline carrier, FEMPIREfreight will seek to
                        recover amounts payable under the applicable Airfreight Convention on your behalf, and you will
                        indemnify FEMPIREfreight and hold it harmless against any claims for loss or damage to your
                        Goods incurred while they were in the possession of the airline carrier. If the Shipment is
                        carried by international road transportation, the Convention for the International Carriage of
                        Goods by Road (CMR) may apply. This convention limits FEMPIREfreight’s liability for loss or
                        damage.

                        26. You acknowledge that Goods moved by airfreight may necessarily involve a part of transport
                        undertaken by other means. Where this is so, and no international treaty is applicable which
                        covers the additional transport, your recovery of loss or damage, if any, is against the carrier
                        and may exclude or substantially limit liability. In the event of any loss or damage suffered by
                        you while the Goods are in the possession of a third-party carrier, FEMPIREfreight will seek to
                        recover from the carrier any amounts payable to you. You indemnify FEMPIREfreight and hold it
                        harmless against any claims for loss or damage to your Goods incurred while they are in the
                        possession of the third-party carrier, where such carriage was necessary in order to complete
                        the delivery of your Shipment.

                        cases where FEMPIREfreight ’s liability is not otherwise limited or excluded, FEMPIREfreight’s

                        law or contract, and that limitation exceeds the limitation of liability pursuant to clause 27
                        above or Accountable Mail below, then the liability pursuant to that Airfreight Convention, law
                        or contract shall apply.

                        29. Any claim for loss or damage must be notified in writing to FEMPIREfreight within seven (7)
                        days of delivery of the Goods or of the date upon which the Goods should have been delivered. In
                        any event, FEMPIREfreight shall be discharged from all liability whatsoever in connection with
                        the Services and/or the Goods unless proceedings are served within 90 days from delivery of the
                        Goods (or from when they should have been delivered). In the event the Goods are fully
                        compensated by FEMPIREfreight for any reason, then you will need to send the damaged goods
                        toFEMPIREfreight in order to receive the compensation for the damaged goods.
